                        <h3><br>Context of Now</h3>
                        <p>My name is Nathaniel Carroll. Born in 1999, in Austin, TX. I grew up in a small town called Taylor, TX, where I attended elementary and middle school. As a teen, I attended a private school, learning the usual curriculum, but opting to learn mandarin over Spanish. I went to college at the University of Texas at Tyler, where I majored in IT with a focus on CyberSecurity and a double minor in mathematics and entrepreneurship.</p>
                        <p><br>Over the years, I have built an extremely technical skillset with backgrounds in residential maintenance, agriculture, programming, engineering and ecology.<br><br></p>
                    
                        <h3>Interests and Hobbies</h3>
                        <p>I am a fan of traveling, experiencing new cultures, cuisines, and relationships. Hobbies of mine include computing and outdoor activities. Some specific interests include Nuclear Energy Research and Self-Sustaining Practices.<br><br></p>
                    
                        <b><i>Purpose Statement</i></b>
                        <small><br>This website is intended to be a "living resume" where I update semi-annually with new trades or skills I have picked up. For more details, please inquire from the home page.</small>

                    <h3><br>SphereOne</h3>
                    <p>Following my graduation from college, I was introduced to Ryan McNutt and Chris Ries through a mutual friend. With these two gentlemen, we worked towards building a Decentralized Non-Collateralized Revolving Loan System. The simplest way to state that is as a crypto-based credit card. My roles here included Development and marketing, primarily. <br></p>
                    <h3><br>Opening Works Gallery</h3>
                    <p>In the last few months of my college career, I focused on networking with artists to create NFTs of their works, and then custodian/broker services for those with intentions to sell. </p>
                    <h3><br>Slenderman University</h3>
                    <p>SlenderU was a "scholarship team" wherein Slenderman and I would provide strangers with the tools required to explore Game Finance and earn an income based on their earnings. This practice is similar to trading in a funded account.<br></p>

                        <p>By virtualizing multiple machines, I can exercise network administrator skills such as firewalls, vlans, portforwarding, etc. </p>
                        <h3><br>File Hosting</h3>
                        <p>I have multiple servers using various storage technologies to optimize read/write speeds, and provide redundancy, across the network. </p>

                    <h3><br>Chatbots</h3>
                    <p>Using tensorflow and pytorch, I have developed a bot that uses .json inputs to be processed and used to generate responses. </p>
